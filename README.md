# plexSleepTimer
A simple Plex sleep timer that interfaces with Tautulli's scripts. Acts as an independent API module or Webhook Implementation/IFTTT. Implemented in PHP and Python.

**TODO:**
- ~~Build connection layout~~
- ~~Insertion of Plex Username and minuteValue values into db~~
- Python Script working correctly
